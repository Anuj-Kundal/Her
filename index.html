  <h1>For You ❤️</h1>
  <p>
    I made this little place for you —  
    not because you asked,  
    not because I had to,  
    but because you matter to me.
    <br><br>
    Sometimes words get lost in conversations.  
    Sometimes emotions get mixed up.  
    Sometimes we don’t say things the way we truly feel.
    <br><br>
    So this is me, slowing everything down,  
    creating a quiet space where you can breathe,  
    read slowly, and just feel.
    <br><br>
    There’s nothing you need to fix here.  
    Nothing you need to prove.  
    <br><br>
    Just stay for a while…  
    and remember —
    <br><br>
    <strong>you are deeply loved.</strong>
  </p>

<!-- WHY I LOVE YOU -->
<section id="love">
  <h2>Why I Love You ❤️</h2>
  <p>
    I love you in ways that are hard to explain,  
    but easy to feel.
    <br><br>
    I love how you care deeply — even when it makes you vulnerable.  
    I love how you feel emotions honestly, without pretending to be strong all the time.
    <br><br>
    I love the way you love — softly, sincerely, and with your whole heart.
    <br><br>
    You are not perfect,  
    but you are real.
    <br><br>
    And in a world where people are often temporary,  
    distracted, or half-present —
    <br><br>
    you are someone who truly shows up.
    <br><br>
    That’s rare.  
    That’s beautiful.  
    That’s you.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- COMFORT -->
<section id="comfort">
  <h2>When You Feel Low 🌙</h2>
  <p>
    This part is for the days when your heart feels heavy,  
    when your thoughts don’t slow down,  
    and when emotions feel too much.
    <br><br>
    You don’t have to be strong all the time.  
    You don’t have to explain everything you’re feeling.
    <br><br>
    It’s okay to feel tired.  
    It’s okay to feel sensitive.  
    It’s okay to need reassurance.
    <br><br>
    Please remember this —
    <br><br>
    your feelings are valid.  
    your emotions are not a burden.  
    and you are never “too much.”
    <br><br>
    Even in your quiet moments,  
    even in your silence,  
    you matter.
    <br><br>
    And you’re not alone in any of it.
  </p>

<!-- PROMISE -->
<section id="promise">
  <h2>My Promise 🤍</h2>
  <p>
    This is not a perfect promise —  
    just an honest one.
    <br><br>
    I promise to keep trying.  
    To listen more carefully.  
    To understand you better.
    <br><br>
    I promise to choose patience over ego,  
    calm over anger,  
    and love over distance.
    <br><br>
    I may make mistakes,  
    but I will never stop caring.
    <br><br>
    No matter what days look like,  
    no matter how conversations go —
    <br><br>
    I want you to know this:
    <br><br>
    <strong>You are chosen.  
    You are valued.  
    And you are important to me.</strong>
